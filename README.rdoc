= Future

Future implements the future concept from IO.
A future is an object that you create now, but which only gets a usable
value in the future. Think of asynchronous messaging and long-lasting method
calls.

An example:
  f = Future.new { sleep 5; 123}
  puts f * 5 #=> 615
Theis future will take 5 seconds to run, then 123 is returned.
The call f.*(5) will block until the future is done.

Another example:
  f1 = Future.new { sleep 5; 10}
  f2 = Future.new { sleep 3; 20}
  f3 = Future.new { sleep 1; 30}
  puts f3 + f2 + f1
Here it only takes 5 seconds to calculate the sum instead of the 9 it would take when done sequentially.
